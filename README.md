## Introduction

This project was part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. Using R, I applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore this dataset for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## The Data

This report explores a dataset from Prosper of 113,937 loans with 81 variables for each loan. These variables include information about the loan such as the amount, rate, length, and status, as well as information on the borrower, such as credit grade, income range, and employment status.

## Project Details

The submitted RMD file should contain:

 1. A stream-of-consciousness analysis and exploration of the data.
    - Headings and text should organize thoughts and reflect the analysis as data was explored.
    - Plots do not need to be polished with labels, units, and titles; these plots are exploratory (quick and dirty). They should, however, be of the appropriate type and effectively convey the information gleaned from them.
 2. A section at the end called "Final Plots and Summary"
    - Three plots should be selected from the analysis to polish and share in this section. The three plots should show different trends and should be polished with appropriate labels, units, and titles.
 3. A final section called "Reflection"
    - This should contain a few sentences about struggles, successes, and ideas for future exploration on the dataset.
